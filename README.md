## About

Eclipse is a PHP app built with Filament and the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/). Its purpose is to offer a solid platform on a modern stack upon which custom web apps can be built. Apart from being compatible with Filament plugins, it aims to offer a set of pre-built modules and other generic components which allow a web app for custom project needs to be built quickly and efficiently with little or no boilerplate code.

It's being developed by [DataLinx](https://www.datalinx.si/), a company in Slovenia/EU, for use in client and own web projects. It's currently in pre-alpha development stage.

### This repository
This repository serves only as the app skeleton/project template and contains as little code as possible. It's a starting point and reference for all Eclipse-based PHP projects.

### Documentation
For further details and documentation please see the **[Eclipse developer documentation](https://datalinx.github.io/eclipsephp-app/)**.
