## About
Eclipse is a PHP app built with Filament and the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/). Its purpose is to offer a solid platform on a modern stack upon which custom web apps can be built. Apart from being compatible with Filament plugins, it aims to offer a set of pre-built modules and other generic components which allow a web app for custom project needs to be built quickly and efficiently with little or no boilerplate code.

It's being developed by [DataLinx](https://www.datalinx.si/), a company in Slovenia/EU, for use in client and own web projects. It's currently in pre-alpha development stage.

### Out-of-the-box features
* User management
* Roles and permissions
* Domain based multi-tenancy (multi-sites)
* Multi-language
* Compatible with standard Laravel and Filament packages
